# Motivation
Game developing companies are constantly improving gaming experience so as to increase engagement and revenue.
However, traditional approaches to understand user experience and feedback, such as research, are expensive and time consuming. For example, reading reviews to identify the criteria by which players evaluate game experience as well as their overall feeling towards the game can is challenging, if not completely unreliable. A person can read a review and interpret in different (or contrasting) ways compared with other colleagues, which makes it difficult to reach reliable conclusions to support game development and business decisions.
